# ðŸ“˜Credit Risk Predictor
This project builds a machine learning model to predict credit risk based on borrower data. The goal is to help financial institutions and lenders make informed decisions by identifying the likelihood of loan default.

## Features
- Preprocessing of financial datasets for model training.
- Exploratory data analysis of key borrower attributes.
- Implementation of machine learning models for risk classification.
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
Clone the repository:
> git clone https://github.com/acexedo/credit-risk-predictor.git

Navigate into the folder:
> cd credit-risk-predictor

Install the dependencies:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Run the notebook:
> jupyter notebook credit_risk.ipynb

The notebook will guide you through data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

## Results
The trained model achieves strong predictive performance, making it useful for risk assessment in lending and financial decision-making contexts.
